# show-touches-js
Show touch visualisation. Written in javascript.

Inspired by built in Android function "Show touches" in Programmer options. Unfortunately it's not available in iOS (hybrid apps) or pure Web. You can use this to show touch events and demonstrate how to use Your application with screen recording.
